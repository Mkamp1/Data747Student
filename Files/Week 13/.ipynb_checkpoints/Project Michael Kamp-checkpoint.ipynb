    "Youth mental health has become a growing public health concern in the United States. National reports indicate increases in sadness, hopelessness, and suicidal behaviors among high school students over the past decade. Understanding which behaviors and demographic factors are associated with mental health risk can help schools, communities, and public health agencies design more focused prevention and support programs.\n",

By analyzing this dataset, the goal is to identify patterns and risk factors that are linked to poor mental health outcomes in adolescents.\n",

These behaviors include mental health indicators, substance use, injury-related behaviors, sexual health, physical activity, and other factors that influence adolescent well-being.
