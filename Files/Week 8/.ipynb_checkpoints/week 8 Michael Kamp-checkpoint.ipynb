    "4. Use appropriate techniques to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.\n",
    "5. Perform basic data analysis on the cleaned dataset to answer the following questions.\n",
    "6. Save the cleaned dataset to a CSV file for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "The \"Adult Income\" dataset contains information about individuals, including their age, education, work class, marital status, occupation, race, gender, native country, and income. The dataset contains 48,842 rows and 14 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverable:\n",
    "Modify this notebook to include the python code as well as any documentation related to your submission.  Submit the notebook as your response in Blackboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
