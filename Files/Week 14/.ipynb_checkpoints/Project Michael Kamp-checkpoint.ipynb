    "# Predicting Factors Associated With Poor Mental Health Among U.S. High School Students\n",
    "\n",
    "Student: Michael Kamp  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, schools across the United States have reported growing concerns about student mental health, including increased levels of anxiety, depression, and stress-related challenges. These mental-health conditions can affect academic performance, attendance, social development, and overall well-being, making early identification an important priority for educators and public-health organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses data from the 2019 CDC Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), a national survey that collects detailed information on student behaviors, demographics, and health outcomes. By analyzing this large-scale dataset, we aim to better understand the factors that may contribute to poor mental-health outcomes among high-school students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis focuses on identifying relationships between demographic characteristics, behavioral patterns, and one key mental-health indicator: whether a student reported feeling sad or hopeless almost every day for at least two weeks (QN8). These insights can help support prevention efforts, guide policy decisions, and highlight risk factors that may require additional attention in school environments.\n",

    "## 2. Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Before preparing the dataset for modeling, this section provides an initial examination of the 2019 CDC Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) data. The goal of Data Understanding is to explore the structure, completeness, and basic characteristics of the dataset to identify potential issues that must be addressed during data preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The YRBSS dataset contains a wide range of behavioral and demographic variables related to youth mental and physical health. In this project, the primary outcome of interest is **QN8**, which indicates whether a student felt sad or hopeless almost every day for ≥2 weeks during the past year.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Preview the Dataset**\n",
    "Displays the first several rows to confirm that variables were imported correctly from the fixed-width `.dat` file using the SAS layout script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Summary Statistics**\n",
    "Generates descriptive statistics for numeric variables to explore ranges, distributions, and potential anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Data Types**\n",
    "Lists the data types of all variables to identify categorical, numeric, and incorrectly inferred types that may require conversion during data preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Missing Values**\n",
    "Identifies variables with missing or CDC-coded missing responses.  \n",
    "The YRBSS dataset frequently uses the following codes for nonresponse:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **7**, **8**, **9**\n",
    "- **77**, **88**, **99**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing these early helps ensure accurate cleaning in later steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Exploration of Key Demographic Variables**\n",
    "Examines unique values for important demographic indicators such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Q2 – Sex**\n",
    "- **Q3 – Grade**\n",
    "- **Q6 – Age Category**\n",
    "- **RACEETH – Race/Ethnicity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding category structure is essential before encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Distribution of Important Behavioral Variables**\n",
    "Creates histograms for continuous or count-based variables such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alcohol use  \n",
    "- Cigarette/vaping use  \n",
    "- Soda consumption  \n",
    "- BMI percentile  \n",
    "\n",
    "These visualizations help detect skewness, outliers, or unusual patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Target Variable Distribution (QN8)**\n",
    "Plots the distribution of the mental-health outcome to assess class imbalance.  \n",
    "This is especially important because only a small percentage of students typically report persistent sadness or hopelessness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By conducting these checks before any cleaning or feature engineering, we establish a clear understanding of the dataset’s structure, potential data-quality issues, and variable characteristics. These findings guide the subsequent **Data Preparation** steps and support accurate, reliable modeling later in the project.\n",

    "## 3. Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this section is to clean, organize, and prepare the 2019 YRBSS dataset for modeling.  \n",
    "Because the raw `.dat` file contains hundreds of variables, mixed formats, and CDC-coded missing values, careful preprocessing is required to ensure analytical accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section outlines each step taken to transform the dataset into a usable modeling table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Load Data Using SAS Layout File**\n",
    "The YRBSS dataset is provided in a fixed-width format.  \n",
    "Column positions and names are extracted programmatically from the official CDC SAS input script, ensuring that variables are imported correctly and consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Select Relevant Variables**\n",
    "A subset of variables was chosen based on their relevance to youth mental health research, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demographics:** Sex (Q2), Grade (Q3), Race/Ethnicity (Q4)  \n",
    "- **Behavioral risk factors:** Alcohol use, cigarette use, vaping, soda consumption, physical inactivity  \n",
    "- **Health indicators:** Obesity status, BMI percentile  \n",
    "- **Target variable:** **QN8** — sadness/hopelessness for ≥2 weeks\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables reflect domains known to influence adolescent mental-health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Recode Target Variable**\n",
    "The mental-health indicator **QN8** is transformed into a binary classification label:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 = Poor mental health**  \n",
    "- **0 = No reported symptoms**\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows supervised machine-learning algorithms to predict mental-health risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Handle Missing and Miscoded Values**\n",
    "CDC YRBSS uses coded values such as *7, 8, 9, 77, 88, 99* to represent non-responses.  \n",
    "These are replaced with `NaN` and imputed using appropriate strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numeric indicators:** Median imputation  \n",
    "- **Categorical indicators:** Most-frequent value imputation  \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures no information loss while preventing bias due to missingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. One-Hot Encode Categorical Variables**\n",
    "Variables such as **Sex, Grade, and Race/Ethnicity** are transformed into numerical dummy variables using `pd.get_dummies(drop_first=True)`.  \n",
    "This avoids multicollinearity and prepares the dataset for logistic regression and decision-trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Scale Numerical Features**\n",
    "Machine-learning models benefit from standardized features.  \n",
    "Numeric columns (e.g., number of cigarettes used, number of days inactive, BMI percentile) are standardized using **StandardScaler** so that each variable has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean = 0  \n",
    "- Standard deviation = 1  \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression especially requires this step for stable and interpretable coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Train-Test Split**\n",
    "The cleaned dataset is split into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **75% Training data**\n",
    "- **25% Testing data**\n",
    "- **Stratified on the target variable (QN8)** to maintain proportional representation\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables fair and unbiased model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "These preparation steps ensure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean and reliable input data  \n",
    "- Proper handling of missing and categorical variables  \n",
    "- Consistent formats for model training  \n",
    "- Reduced noise and improved predictive accuracy  \n",
    "\n",
    "With the dataset now fully prepared, the next section (Modeling) builds and evaluates the machine-learning models.\n",

    "In this section, we evaluate the performance of our supervised machine-learning models and assess their ability to accurately predict whether a student reported poor mental health (persistent sadness or hopelessness).
