    "## Lab Assignment: Data Visualization with Matplotlib\n",
    "Student:     **Michael Kamp**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective: To use Matplotlib to perform basic data visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "In this lab assignment, you will explore data visualization using Python's Matplotlib library. You will use Matplotlib to create various visualizations based on provided datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a line plot of the provided dataset with years on the x-axis and population on the y-axis.\n",
    "2. Create a scatter plot of the provided dataset with horsepower on the x-axis and miles per gallon (mpg) on the y-axis.\n",
    "3. Create a bar chart of the provided dataset with car brands on the x-axis and average price on the y-axis.\n",
    "4. Create a histogram of the provided dataset with salaries on the x-axis and frequency on the y-axis.\n",
    "5. Create a pie chart of the provided dataset with the percentage of car sales of each brand.\n",
    "6. Create a stacked bar chart of the provided dataset with the years on the x-axis and the total number of medals won by each country on the y-axis. The stacked bars should show the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals won.\n",
    "7. Create a box plot of the provided dataset with car prices grouped by brand.\n",
    "8. Create a violin plot of the provided dataset with car prices grouped by brand.\n",
    "9. Create a hexbin plot of the provided dataset with car prices on the x-axis and mileage on the y-axis.\n",
    "10. Create a 3D scatter plot of the provided dataset with horsepower on the x-axis, weight on the y-axis, and miles per gallon on the z-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: You can use sample datasets provided by Matplotlib or any other publicly available dataset for the above problems)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverable:\n",
    "Modify this notebook to include the python code as well as any documentation related to your submission.  Submit the notebook as your response in Blackboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your lab assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correctness of the implementation\n",
    "- Proper use of basic control structures and functions\n",
    "- Code efficiency\n",
    "- Clarity and readability of the code\n",
    "- Compliance with the instructions and deliverables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Student Submission\n",
    "1.  Create a line plot of the provided dataset with years on the x-axis and population on the y-axis."
