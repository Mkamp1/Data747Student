    "## Lab Assignment: Data Cleaning and Preparation\n",
    "Student:     **INSERT YOUR NAME HERE**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective: To apply the techniques learned in class to clean and prepare data for analysis. Specifically, students will learn how to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers in data. By the end of the lab assignment, students should be able to clean and prepare data for further analysis using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "1. Download and import the \"Adult Income\" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "2. Load the data into a DataFrame.\n",
    "3. Explore the dataset and identify missing values, duplicates, and outliers.\n",
    "4. Use appropriate techniques to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.\n",
    "5. Perform basic data analysis on the cleaned dataset to answer the following questions.\n",
    "6. Save the cleaned dataset to a CSV file for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "The \"Adult Income\" dataset contains information about individuals, including their age, education, work class, marital status, occupation, race, gender, native country, and income. The dataset contains 48,842 rows and 14 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverable:\n",
    "Modify this notebook to include the python code as well as any documentation related to your submission.  Submit the notebook as your response in Blackboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your lab assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correctness of the implementation\n",
    "- Proper use of basic control structures and functions\n",
    "- Code efficiency\n",
    "- Clarity and readability of the code\n",
    "- Compliance with the instructions and deliverables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Student Submission\n",
    "Download aind import the \"Adult Income\" dataset into a pandas dataframe"
